## Features
This system presents a relationship between doctors, patients, pharmacies and medical laboratories to establish a linking relationship between the medical sector and provides:

* It is given to doctors who are authorized to trade the profession and who are registered to enter the system and create an account to follow the patient history of their patients by displaying all their patient history.
* Doctors are allowed to add prescriptions, tests, and medical x-rays for them to be kept in their medical record.
* Pharmacies are allowed to access the patient’s file with his national number to display only his prescriptions and give him medicine to get rid of the idea of paper prescriptions.
* Medical laboratories are allowed to display the required analyzes and x-rays in the patient’s file, perform them for him, and send the result to his account on the website.
* Finally, it gives an easy-to-use interface for the patient to see and follow his medical history and receive notifications of the result of his medical test when sent from the lab.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
